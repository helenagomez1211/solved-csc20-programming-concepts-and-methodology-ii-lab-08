Objective:

This assignment will give you practice in developing a simple GUI. In Lab 09, we will add code to deal with events.

The programming assignment:

In this assignment you are to use Java GUI widget toolkit to develop a GUI interface for a simple calculator. For now, your code will just produce and display the GUI elements, but will not respond to any events. The GUI should look closely like the following.










Some programming hints:




<ol>

 <li>Use one of the examples in the instructorâ€™s power point notes as the base of your program.</li>

 <li>Obviously, you need a top-level container, JFrame.</li>

 <li>To help you organize the GUI, you might need a couple of secondary containers, JPanel, to group GUI elements together.</li>

 <li>You need a JTextField and lots of JButtons.</li>

</ol>
